# AutoLiker

AutoLiker is a Firefox/Greasemonkey powered script that allows the user to like a certain number of Instagram media on a given Instagram webpage.

> The idea has come from my wife, she likes to use her instagram account, but spend a lot of time liking hashtag media for a promotion or a group of marketing. I was just helping her to achieve her goals and spend more time with me! :)

  - Instagram hashtag page
